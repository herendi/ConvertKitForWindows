# ConvertKit for Windows

This application is an unofficial port of [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) for the universal Windows platform. It's built with [WinJS](https://github.com/winjs/winjs), an implementation of HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript that runs both natively in Windows and can be loaded as a library in the browser. In Windows, a WinJS app is both first-class and native, which means the app runs on bare metal rather than being loaded through a performance-killing webview like you'd find on iOS or Android.

## About

My name is [Joshua Harms](https://nozzlegear.com/about), and I built this application because I needed a way to get alerts when new subscribers joined my ConvertKit list. I'd be a poor ConvertKit user if I didn't mention that I'm writing [The Shopify Development Handbook](https://nozzlegear.com/shopify-development-handbook?ref=ConvertKitForWindows), a premium course for building Shopify apps and integrations with C# and ASP.NET.
